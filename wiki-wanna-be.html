                        A black hole is a region of

                        where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity">gravity</a> is so strong that nothing — no

                            radiation</a> such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light">light</a> — can escape
                        from it. The theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity">general
                            relativity</a> predicts that a sufficiently compact <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass">mass</a> can deform spacetime to form a black
                        hole.

                        The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the <a

                        Although the event horizon has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object
                        crossing it, according to general relativity it has no locally detectable features. In many
                        ways, a black hole acts like an ideal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_body">black
                            body</a>, as it reflects no light. Moreover,

                            field theory in curved spacetime</a> predicts that event horizons emit <a

                        temperature is on the order of billionths of a <a

                        making it
                        essentially impossible to observe.

                        Objects whose <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_field">gravitational
                            fields</a> are too strong for light to escape were first considered in
                        the 18th century by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Michell">John Michell</a> and <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Simon_Laplace">Pierre-Simon Laplace</a>. The
                        first modern solution of
                        general relativity that would characterize a black hole was found by <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Schwarzschild">Karl Schwarzschild</a> in 1916,
                        although its interpretation as a region of space from which nothing can escape was first
                        published by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Finkelstein">David Finkelstein</a> in
                        1958. Black holes were long considered a mathematical
                        curiosity; it was not until the 1960s that theoretical work showed they were a generic
                        prediction of general relativity. The discovery of <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star">neutron stars</a> by <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jocelyn_Bell_Burnell">Jocelyn Bell Burnell</a> in 1967
                        sparked interest in <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_collapse">gravitationally collapsed</a>
                        compact objects as a possible astrophysical
                        reality.

                        Black holes of stellar mass are expected to form when very massive stars collapse at the end of
                        their life cycle. After a black hole has formed, it can continue to grow by absorbing mass from
                        its surroundings. By absorbing other stars and merging with other black holes, <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermassive_black_hole">supermassive
                            black holes</a> of millions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_mass">solar
                            masses</a> (M<sub>☉</sub>) may form. There is consensus that
                        supermassive
                        black holes exist in the centers of most <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy">galaxies</a>.

                        The presence of a black hole can be inferred through its interaction with other <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter">matter</a> and with
                        electromagnetic radiation such as visible light. Matter that falls onto a black hole can form an
                        external <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accretion_disk">accretion disk</a> heated by
                        friction, forming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasar">quasars</a>, some of the
                        brightest objects in
                        the universe. Stars passing too close to a supermassive black hole can be shred into streamers
                        that shine very brightly before being "swallowed." If there are other stars orbiting a black
                        hole, their orbits can be used to determine the black hole's mass and location. Such
                        observations can be used to exclude possible alternatives such as neutron stars. In this way,
                        astronomers have identified numerous stellar black hole candidates in <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_star">binary systems</a>, and
                        established that the radio source known as <a

                        contains a supermassive black hole of about 4.3 million solar masses.

                        The idea of a body so massive that even light could not escape was briefly proposed by
                        astronomical pioneer and English clergyman <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Michell">John Michell</a> in a letter published in
                        November 1784.
                        Michell's simplistic calculations assumed such a body might have the same density as the Sun,
                        and concluded that such a body would form when a star's diameter exceeds the Sun's by a factor
                        of 500, and the surface <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity">escape
                            velocity</a> exceeds the usual speed of light. Michell correctly
                        noted that such supermassive but non-radiating bodies might be detectable through their
                        gravitational effects on nearby visible bodies. Scholars of the time were initially
                        excited by the proposal that giant but invisible stars might be hiding in plain view, but
                        enthusiasm dampened when the wavelike nature of light became apparent in the early nineteenth
                        century.

                        If light were a wave rather than a <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle">"corpuscle"</a>, it is unclear what, if any,
                        influence gravity
                        would have on escaping light waves. Modern physics discredits Michell's notion of a light
                        ray shooting directly from the surface of a supermassive star, being slowed down by the star's
                        gravity, stopping, and then free-falling back to the star's surface.

                        of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrik_Lorentz">Hendrik Lorentz</a>, independently
                        gave the same solution for the point mass and wrote more
                        extensively about its properties. This solution had a peculiar behaviour at what is now
                        called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_radius">Schwarzschild
                            radius</a>, where it became <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularity_(mathematics)">singular</a>, meaning that
                        some of the terms in the
                        Einstein equations became infinite. The nature of this surface was not quite understood at the
                        time. In 1924, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Eddington">Arthur Eddington</a>
                        showed that the singularity disappeared after a change of
                        coordinates (see <a

                            Lemaître</a> to realize that this meant the singularity at the Schwarzschild radius was a

                            singularity</a>. Arthur Eddington did however comment on the possibility
                        of a star with mass compressed to the Schwarzschild radius in a 1926 book, noting that
                        Einstein's theory allows us to rule out overly large densities for visible stars like Betelgeuse
                        because "a star of 250 million km radius could not possibly have so high a density as the sun.
                        Firstly, the force of gravitation would be so great that light would be unable to escape from
                        it, the rays falling back to the star like a stone to the earth. Secondly, the red shift of the
                        spectral lines would be so great that the spectrum would be shifted out of existence. Thirdly,
                        the mass would produce so much curvature of the space-time metric that space would close up
                        around the star, leaving us outside (i.e., nowhere)."

                        In 1931, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subrahmanyan_Chandrasekhar">Subrahmanyan

                        of his
                        contemporaries like Eddington and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Landau">Lev
                            Landau</a>, who argued that some yet unknown mechanism would
                        stop the collapse. They were partly correct: a <a

                        the
                        Chandrasekhar limit will collapse into a neutron star, which is itself stable. But in 1939, <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Robert_Oppenheimer">Robert Oppenheimer</a> and others
                        predicted that neutron stars above another limit (the <a

                        Chandrasekhar, and concluded that no law of physics was likely to intervene and stop at least
                        some stars from collapsing to black holes. Their original calculations, based on the <a

                        force-mediated
                        neutron-neutron repulsion raised the estimate to approximately 1.5 M<sub>☉</sub> to 3.0

                        Oppenheimer and his co-authors interpreted the singularity at the boundary of the Schwarzschild
                        radius as indicating that this was the boundary of a bubble in which time stopped. This is a
                        valid point of view for external observers, but not for infalling observers. Because of this
                        property, the collapsed stars were called "frozen stars", because an outside observer would see
                        the surface of the star frozen in time at the instant where its collapse takes it to the
                        Schwarzschild radius.

                        In 1958, David Finkelstein identified the Schwarzschild surface as an event horizon, "a perfect
                        unidirectional membrane: causal influences can cross it in only one direction".This did not
                        strictly contradict Oppenheimer's results, but extended them to include the point of view of
                        infalling observers. Finkelstein's solution extended the Schwarzschild solution for the future
                        of observers falling into a black hole. A <a

                        general relativity and black holes becoming mainstream subjects of research. This process was
                        helped by the discovery of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsar">pulsars</a> by <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jocelyn_Bell_Burnell">Jocelyn Bell Burnell</a> in 1967,
                        which, by 1969, were
                        shown to be rapidly rotating neutron stars. Until that time, neutron stars, like black
                        holes, were regarded as just theoretical curiosities; but the discovery of pulsars showed their
                        physical relevance and spurred a further interest in all types of compact objects that might be
                        formed by gravitational collapse.

                        In this period more general black hole solutions were found. In 1963, <a

                        emerged, stating
                        that a stationary black hole solution is completely described by the three parameters of the

                        At first, it was suspected that the strange features of the black hole solutions were
                        pathological artifacts from the symmetry conditions imposed, and that the singularities would
                        not appear in generic situations. This view was held in particular by <a

                        John Michell used the term "dark star", and in the early 20th century, physicists used the
                        term "gravitationally collapsed object". Science writer Marcia Bartusiak traces the term "black

                        who in the early 1960s reportedly compared the phenomenon to

                        notorious as a prison where people entered but never left alive.

                        The term "black hole" was used in print by <a

                        science journalist Ann Ewing in her article "'Black Holes' in Space", dated 18 January 1964,
                        which was a report on a meeting of the <a

                        The no-hair conjecture postulates that, once it achieves a stable condition after formation, a
                        black hole has only three independent physical properties: mass, charge, and angular momentum;
                        the black hole is otherwise featureless. If the conjecture is true, any two black holes that
                        share the same values for these properties, or parameters, are indistinguishable from one
                        another. The degree to which the conjecture is true for real black holes under the laws of
                        modern physics, is currently an unsolved problem.

                        These properties are special because they are visible from outside a black hole. For example, a
                        charged black hole repels other like charges just like any other charged object. Similarly, the
                        total mass inside a sphere containing a black hole can be found by using the gravitational
                        analog of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%27s_law">Gauss's law</a> (through the <a

                        away from the black hole. Likewise, the

                        The simplest static black holes have mass but neither electric charge nor angular momentum.
                        These
                        black holes are often referred to as <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_metric">Schwarzschild black holes</a>
                        after Karl Schwarzschild who
                        discovered this solution in 1916. According to <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birkhoff%27s_theorem_(relativity)">Birkhoff's
                            theorem</a>, it is the only <a

                            solution</a> that is <a

                            symmetric</a>. This means there is no observable difference at a
                        distance between the gravitational field of such a black hole and that of any other spherical
                        object of the same mass. The popular notion of a black hole "sucking in everything" in its
                        surroundings is therefore correct only near a black hole's horizon; far away, the external
                        gravitational field is identical to that of any other body of the same mass.

                        Solutions describing more general black holes also exist. Non-rotating <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charged_black_hole">charged black holes</a> are
                        described by the <a

                            metric</a>, while the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerr_metric">Kerr metric</a>
                        describes a non-charged
                        rotating black hole. The most general <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_spacetime">stationary</a> black hole solution
                        known is the Kerr–Newman metric, which describes a black hole with both charge and angular
                        momentum.

                        While the mass of a black hole can take any positive value, the charge and angular momentum are
                        constrained by the mass. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_units">Planck
                            units</a>, the total electric charge Q and the total angular
                        momentum J are expected to satisfy

                        for a black hole of mass M. Black holes with the minimum possible mass satisfying this
                        inequality are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremal_black_hole">external</a>.
                        Solutions of Einstein's equations that violate this inequality
                        exist, but they do not possess an event horizon. These solutions have so-called <a

                            censorship hypothesis</a> rules out the formation of such singularities, when they are

                        collapse of stars are expected to retain the nearly neutral charge of the star. Rotation,
                        however, is expected to be a universal feature of compact astrophysical objects. The black-hole

                        The defining feature of a black hole is the appearance of an event horizon—a boundary in
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime">spacetime</a> through which matter and light
                        can pass only inward towards the mass of the black
                        hole. Nothing, not even light, can escape from inside the event horizon. The event
                        horizon is referred to as such because if an event occurs within the boundary, information from
                        that event cannot reach an outside observer, making it impossible to determine whether such an
                        event occurred.

                        As predicted by general relativity, the presence of a mass deforms spacetime in such a way that
                        the paths taken by particles bend towards the mass. At the event horizon of a black hole,
                        this deformation becomes so strong that there are no paths that lead away from the black
                        hole.

                        To a distant observer, clocks near a black hole would appear to tick more slowly than those
                        further away from the black hole. Due to this effect, know as <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_time_dilation">gravitational time
                            dilation</a>,
                        an object falling into a black hole appears to slow as it approaches the event horizon, taking
                        an infinite time to reach it. At the same time, all processes on this object slow down, from
                        the view point of a fixed outside observer, causing any light emitted by the object to appear
                        redder and dimmer, an effect known as <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_redshift">gravitational
                            redshift</a>.Eventually, the falling object
                        fades away until it can no longer be seen. Typically this process happens very rapidly with an
                        object disappearing from view within less than a second.

                        On the other hand, indestructible observers falling into a black hole do not notice any of these
                        effects as they cross the event horizon. According to their own clocks, which appear to them to
                        tick normally, they cross the event horizon after a finite time without noting any singular
                        behaviour; in classical general relativity, it is impossible to determine the location of the
                        event horizon from local observations, due to Einstein's <a

                        non-rotating (static) black holes the geometry of the event horizon is precisely
                        spherical, while for rotating black holes the event horizon is oblate.

                    <p>
                        At the center of a black hole, as described by general relativity, may lie a <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_singularity">gravitational
                            singularity</a>, a region where the spacetime curvature becomes infinite.For a non-rotating
                        black hole, this region takes the shape of a single point and for a rotating black hole, it is
                        smeared out to form a ring singularity that lies in the plane of rotation. In both cases,
                        the singular region has zero volume. It can also be shown that the singular region contains all
                        the mass of the black hole solution. The singular region can thus be thought of as having
                        infinite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density">density</a>.

                        Observers falling into a Schwarzschild black hole (i.e., non-rotating and not charged) cannot
                        avoid being carried into the singularity once they cross the event horizon. They can prolong the
                        experience by accelerating away to slow their descent, but only up to a limit. When they
                        reach the singularity, they are crushed to infinite density and their mass is added to the total
                        of the black hole. Before that happens, they will have been torn apart by the growing <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_force">tidal
                            forces</a> in a process sometimes referred to as <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghettification">spaghettification</a> or the "noodle
                        effect".

                        In the case of a charged (Reissner–Nordström) or rotating (Kerr) black hole, it is possible to
                        avoid the singularity. Extending these solutions as far as possible reveals the hypothetical
                        possibility of exiting the black hole into a different spacetime with the black hole acting as a
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wormhole">wormhole</a>. The possibility of traveling to
                        another universe is, however, only theoretical
                        since any perturbation would destroy this possibility.It also appears to be possible to
                        follow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_timelike_curve">closed timelike curves</a>
                        (returning to one's own past) around the Kerr singularity, which
                        leads to problems with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality_(physics)">causality</a>
                        like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandfather_paradox">grandfather paradox</a>. It
                        is expected that none of
                        these peculiar effects would survive in a proper quantum treatment of rotating and charged black
                        holes.

                        The appearance of singularities in general relativity is commonly perceived as signaling the
                        breakdown of the theory. This breakdown, however, is expected; it occurs in a situation
                        where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics">quantum effects</a> should
                        describe these actions, due to the extremely high density and
                        therefore particle interactions. To date, it has not been possible to combine quantum and
                        gravitational effects into a single theory, although there exist attempts to formulate such a
                        theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_gravity">quantum gravity</a>. It is
                        generally expected that such a theory will not feature any
                        singularities.

                        The photon sphere is a spherical boundary of zero thickness in which <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon">photons</a> that move on <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent">tangents</a> to that sphere would be trapped in
                        a circular orbit about the black hole. For
                        non-rotating black holes, the photon sphere has a radius 1.5 times the Schwarzschild radius.
                        Their orbits would be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instability">dynamically
                            unstable</a>, hence any small perturbation, such as a particle of
                        infalling matter, would cause an instability that would grow over time, either setting the
                        photon on an outward trajectory causing it to escape the black hole, or on an inward spiral
                        where it would eventually cross the event horizon.

                        While light can still escape from the photon sphere, any light that crosses the photon sphere on
                        an inbound trajectory will be captured by the black hole. Hence any light that reaches an
                        outside observer from the photon sphere must have been emitted by objects between the photon
                        sphere and the event horizon. For a Kerr black hole the radius of the photon sphere depends
                        on the spin parameter and on the details of the photon orbit, which can be prograde (the photon
                        rotates in the same sense of the black hole spin) or retrograde.

                        Rotating black holes are surrounded by a region of spacetime in which it is impossible to stand
                        still, called the ergosphere. This is the result of a process known as <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame-dragging">frame-dragging</a>; general
                        relativity predicts that any rotating mass will tend to slightly "drag" along the spacetime
                        immediately surrounding it. Any object near the rotating mass will tend to start moving in the
                        direction of rotation. For a rotating black hole, this effect is so strong near the event
                        horizon that an object would have to move faster than the speed of light in the opposite
                        direction to just stand still.

                        The ergosphere of a black hole is a volume whose inner boundary is the black hole's event
                        horizon and an outer boundary called the ergosurface, which coincides with the event horizon at
                        the poles but noticeably wider around the equator.

                        Objects and radiation can escape normally from the ergosphere. Through the <a

                        objects can emerge from the ergosphere with more energy than they entered with. The extra energy
                        is taken from the rotational energy of the black hole. Thereby the rotation of the black hole
                        slows down. A variation of the Penrose process in the presence of strong magnetic fields,

                        Given the bizarre character of black holes, it was long questioned whether such objects
                        couldactually exist in nature or whether they were merely pathological solutions to
                        Einstein'sequations. Einstein himself wrongly thought black holes would not form, because he
                        held that the angular momentum of collapsing particles would stabilize their motion at some
                        radius. This led the general relativity community to dismiss all results to the contrary for
                        many years.

                        However, a minority of relativists continued to contend that black holes were physical
                        objects, and by the end of the 1960s, they had persuaded the majority of researchers in the
                        field that there is no obstacle to the formation of an event horizon.

                        Penrose demonstrated that once an event horizon forms, general relativity without quantum
                        mechanics requires that a singularity will form within. Shortly afterwards, Hawking showed
                        that many cosmological solutions that describe the <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang">Big Bang</a> have singularities without <a

                        The Kerr solution, the no-hair theorem, and the laws of black hole thermodynamics showed
                        that the physical properties of black holes were simple and comprehensible, making them
                        respectable subjects for research. Conventional black holes are formed by gravitational
                        collapse of heavy objects such as stars, but they can also in theory be formed by other
                        processes.

                        Gravitational collapse occurs when an object's internal <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure">pressure</a> is insufficient to resist the
                        object's own gravity. For stars this usually occurs either because a star has too little "fuel"
                        left to maintain its temperature through <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_nucleosynthesis">stellar nucleosynthesis</a>, or
                        because a star that would
                        have been stable receives extra matter in a way that does not raise its core temperature. In
                        either case the star's temperature is no longer high enough to prevent it from collapsing under
                        its own weight. The collapse may be stopped by the <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerate_matter">degeneracy pressure</a> of the star's
                        constituents, allowing the condensation of matter into an exotic <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerate_matter">denser state</a>. The result is one
                        of the various types of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_star">compact star</a>.
                        Which type forms depends on the mass of the remnant of the
                        original star left if the outer layers have been blown away (for example, in a <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_II_supernova">Type II
                            supernova)</a>. The mass of the remnant, the collapsed object that survives the explosion,
                        can be
                        substantially less than that of the original star. Remnants exceeding 5 M☉ are produced by stars
                        that were over 20 M<sub>☉</sub> before the collapse.

                        If the mass of the remnant exceeds about 3–4 M<sub>☉</sub> (the <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolman%E2%80%93Oppenheimer%E2%80%93Volkoff_limit">Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff
                            limit</a>), either because the original star was very heavy or because the remnant collected
                        additional mass through accretion of matter, even the degeneracy pressure of <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron">neutrons</a> is
                        insufficient to stop the collapse. No known mechanism (except possibly quark degeneracy
                        pressure, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark_star">quark star</a>) is powerful
                        enough to stop the implosion and the object will
                        inevitably collapse to form a black hole.
                        The gravitational collapse of heavy stars is assumed to be responsible for the formation of <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_black_hole">stellar mass black holes</a>. <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_formation">Star formation</a> in the early universe
                        may have resulted in very massive
                        stars, which upon their collapse would have produced black holes of up to 10<sup>3</sup>
                        M<sub>☉</sub>. These black holes could be the seeds of the supermassive black holes found in the
                        centers of most galaxies. It has further been suggested that massive black holes with typical
                        masses of ~10<sup>5</sup> M<sub>☉</sub> could have formed from the direct collapse of gas clouds
                        in the young universe. These massive objects have been proposed as the seeds that eventually
                        formed the earliest quasars observed already at redshift <dfn>Z</dfn> ~ 7. Some candidates for
                        such objects have been found in observations of the young universe.

                        While most of the energy released during gravitational collapse is emitted very quickly, an
                        outside observer does not actually see the end of this process. Even though the collapse takes a
                        finite amount of time from the <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference">reference frame</a> of infalling
                        matter, a distant observer would see
                        the infalling material slow and halt just above the event horizon, due to <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_time_dilation">gravitational time
                            dilation</a>. Light from the collapsing material takes longer and longer to reach the
                        observer, with
                        the light emitted just before the event horizon forms delayed an infinite amount of time. Thus
                        the external observer never sees the formation of the event horizon; instead, the collapsing
                        material seems to become dimmer and increasingly red-shifted, eventually fading away.

                    <p>
                        Gravitational collapse requires great density. In the current epoch of the universe these high
                        densities are found only in stars, but in the early universe shortly after the Big Bang
                        densities were much greater, possibly allowing for the creation of black holes. High density
                        alone is not enough to allow black hole formation since a uniform mass distribution will not
                        allow the mass to bunch up. In order for <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primordial_black_hole">primordial black holes</a> to
                        have formed in such a dense
                        medium, there must have been initial density perturbations that could then grow under their own
                        gravity. Different models for the early universe vary widely in their predictions of the scale
                        of these fluctuations. Various models predict the creation of primordial black holes ranging in
                        size from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_mass">Planck mass</a> to hundreds of
                        thousands of solar masses.

                        Despite the early universe being extremely dense—far denser than is usually required to form a
                        black hole—it did not re-collapse into a black hole during the Big Bang. Models for
                        gravitational collapse of objects of relatively constant size, such as <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star">stars</a>, do not necessarily
                        apply in the same way to rapidly expanding space such as the Big Bang.

                        Gravitational collapse is not the only process that could create black holes. In principle,
                        black holes could be formed in <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics">high-energy</a> collisions that
                        achieve sufficient density. As of
                        2002, no such events have been detected, either directly or indirectly as a deficiency of the
                        mass balance in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_accelerator">particle
                            accelerator</a> experiments. This suggests that there must be a lower limit
                        for the mass of black holes. Theoretically, this boundary is expected to lie around the Planck
                        mass where quantum effects are expected to invalidate the predictions of general relativity.
                        This would put the creation of black holes firmly out of reach of any high-energy process
                        occurring on or near the Earth. However, certain developments in quantum gravity suggest that
                        the minimum black hole mass could be much lower: some <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brane_cosmology">braneworld</a> scenarios for example
                        put the
                        boundary as low as 1 TeV/c<sup>2</sup>. This would make it conceivable for micro black holes to
                        be created in the high-energy collisions that occur when <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray">cosmic rays</a> hit the Earth's atmosphere,

                        black holes could be formed, it is expected that they would <a

                        Once a black hole has formed, it can continue to grow by absorbing additional matter. Any black
                        hole will continually absorb gas and <a

                        black holes.
                        This is thought to have been important, especially in the early growth of supermassive black
                        holes, which could have formed from the aggregation of many smaller objects. The process has
                        also been proposed as the origin of some intermediate-mass black holes.

                    <p>
                        In 1974, Hawking predicted that black holes are not entirely black but emit small amounts of
                        thermal radiation at a temperature ℏ c<sup>3</sup>/(8 π G M k<sub>B</sub>);this effect has
                        become known as Hawking radiation. By applying quantum field theory to a static black hole
                        background, he determined that a black hole should emit particles that display a perfect <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation">black
                            body spectrum</a>.
                        Since Hawking's publication, many others have verified the result through various approaches. If
                        Hawking's theory of black hole radiation is correct, then black holes are expected to shrink and
                        evaporate over time as they lose mass by the emission of photons and other particles. The
                        temperature of this thermal spectrum (<a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation">Hawking temperature</a>)
                        isproportional to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_gravity">surface
                            gravity</a> of the black hole, which, for a Schwarzschild black hole, is
                        inversely proportional to the mass. Hence, large black holes emit less radiation than small
                        black holes.

                        A stellar black hole of 1 M<sub>☉</sub> has a Hawking temperature of 62 <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(temperature)">nanokelvins</a>. This
                        is far
                        less than the 2.7 K temperature of the <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background">cosmic microwave
                            background</a> radiation. Stellar-mass or
                        larger
                        black holes receive more mass from the cosmic microwave background than they emit through
                        Hawking radiation and thus will grow instead of shrinking.To have a Hawking temperature larger
                        than 2.7 K (and be able to evaporate), a black hole would need a mass less than the Moon. Such a
                        black hole would have a diameter of less than a tenth of a millimeter.

                        If a black hole is very small, the radiation effects are expected to become very strong. A black
                        hole with the mass of a car would have a diameter of about 10<sup>-24</sup> m and take a
                        nanosecond to evaporate, during which time it would briefly have a luminosity of more than 200
                        times that of
                        the Sun. Lower-mass black holes are expected to evaporate even faster; for example, a black hole
                        of mass 1 TeV/c<sup>2</sup> would take less than 10<sup>-88</sup> seconds to evaporate
                        completely. For such a small
                        black hole, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_gravity">quantum gravitation</a>
                        effects are expected to play an important role and could
                        hypothetically make such a small black hole stable, although current developments in quantum
                        gravity do not indicate this is the case.

                        The Hawking radiation for an astrophysical black hole is predicted to be very weak and would
                        thus be exceedingly difficult to detect from Earth. A possible exception, however, is the burst
                        of gamma rays emitted in the last stage of the evaporation of primordial black holes. Searches
                        for such flashes have proven unsuccessful and provide stringent limits on the possibility of
                        existence of low mass primordial black holes.NASA's <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_Gamma-ray_Space_Telescope">Fermi Gamma-ray Space

                        2008 will continue the search for these flashes.

                        If black holes evaporate via Hawking radiation, a solar mass black hole will evaporate
                        (beginning once the temperature of the cosmic microwave background drops below that of the black
                        hole) over a period of 10<sup>64</sup> years. A supermassive black hole with a mass of
                        10<sup>11</sup>(100 billion) M<sub>☉</sub> will evaporate in around 2×10<sup>100</sup> years.
                        Some monster black holes in the universe are predicted to continue to grow up to perhaps
                        10<sup>14</sup> M<sub>☉</sub> during the collapse of superclusters of galaxies. Even these would
                        evaporate over a timescale of up to 10<sup>106</sup> years.

                    <p>
                        By nature, black holes do not themselves emit any electromagnetic radiation other than the
                        ypothetical Hawking radiation, so astrophysicists searching for black holes must generally rely
                        on indirect observations. For example, a black hole's existence can sometimes be inferred by
                        observing its gravitational influence upon its surroundings.

                        On 10 April 2019 an image was released of a black hole, which is seen in magnified fashion
                        because the light paths near the event horizon are highly bent. The dark shadow in the middle <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_color">false color</a>, as the radio waves.

                        The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_Horizon_Telescope">Event Horizon Telescope</a>
                        (EHT), is an active program that directly observes the immediate
                        environment of the event horizon of black holes, such as the black hole at the centre of the
                        Milky Way. In April 2017, EHT began observation of the black hole in the center of Messier 87.
                        "In all, eight radio observatories on six mountains and four continents observed the galaxy in
                        Virgo on and off for 10 days in April 2017" to provide the data yielding the image two years
                        later in April 2019. After two years of data processing, EHT released the first direct image of
                        a black hole, specifically the supermassive black hole that lies in the center of the
                        aforementioned galaxy. What is visible is not the black hole, which shows as black because of
                        the loss of all light within this dark region, rather it is the gases at the edge of the event
                        horizon, which are displayed as orange or red, that define the black hole.
                        The brightening of this material in the 'bottom' half of the processed EHT image is thought to
                        be caused by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_beaming">Doppler beaming</a>,
                        whereby material approaching the viewer at relativistic speeds is
                        perceived as brighter than material moving away. In the case of a black hole this phenomenon
                        implies that the visible material is rotating at relativistic speeds (>1,000 km/s), the only
                        speeds at which it is possible to centrifugally balance the immense gravitational attraction of
                        the singularity, and thereby remain in orbit above the event horizon. This configuration of
                        bright material implies that the EHT observed <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_87#Supermassive_black_hole_M87*">M87*</a> from a
                        perspective catching the black hole's
                        accretion disc nearly edge-on, as the whole system rotated clockwise. However, the extreme <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lens">gravitational lensing</a> associated
                        with black holes produces the illusion of a perspective that
                        sees the accretion disc from above. In reality, most of the ring in the EHT image was created
                        when the light emitted by the far side of the accretion disc bent around the black hole's
                        gravity well and escaped such that most of the possible perspectives on M87* can see the entire
                        disc, even that directly behind the "shadow".

                        Prior to this, in 2015, the EHT detected magnetic fields just outside the event horizon of
                        Sagittarius A*, and even discerned some of their properties. The field lines that pass through
                        the accretion disc were found to be a complex mixture of ordered and tangled. The existence of
                        magnetic fields had been predicted by theoretical studies of black holes.

                    <p>
                        In 1971, Hawking showed under general conditions that the total area of the event
                        horizons of any collection of classical black holes can never decrease, even if they collide and
                        merge. This result, now known as the <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole_thermodynamics#The_Second_Law">second law of
                            black hole mechanics</a>, is remarkably
                        similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics">second law
                            of thermodynamics</a>, which states that the total <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy">entropy</a> of an isolated
                        system can never decrease. As with classical objects at <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_zero">absolute zero</a> temperature, it was
                        assumed that black holes had zero entropy. If this were the case, the second law of
                        thermodynamics would be violated by entropy-laden matter entering a black hole, resulting in a
                        decrease of the total entropy of the universe. Therefore, Bekenstein proposed that a black hole
                        should have an entropy, and that it should be proportional to its horizon area.

                        The link with the laws of thermodynamics was further strengthened by Hawking's discovery that
                        quantum field theory predicts that a black hole radiates blackbody radiation at a constant
                        temperature. This seemingly causes a violation of the second law of black hole mechanics, since
                        the radiation will carry away energy from the black hole causing it to shrink. The radiation,
                        however also carries away entropy, and it can be proven under general assumptions that the sum
                        of the entropy of the matter surrounding a black hole and one quarter of the area of the horizon
                        as measured in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_units">Planck units</a> is in fact
                        always increasing. This allows the formulation of the <a

                        mass acting as energy, the surface gravity as temperature and the area as entropy.

                        One puzzling feature is that the entropy of a black hole scales with its area rather than with
                        its volume, since entropy is normally an <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_and_extensive_properties">extensive
                            quantity</a> that scales linearly with the volume
                        of the system. This odd property led <a

                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle">holographic principle</a>, which
                        suggests that anything that happens in a volume of spacetime can be
                        described by data on the boundary of that volume.

                        Although general relativity can be used to perform a semi-classical calculation of black hole
                        entropy, this situation is theoretically unsatisfying. In <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_mechanics">statistical mechanics</a>,
                        entropy is
                        understood as counting the number of microscopic configurations of a system that have the same
                        macroscopic qualities (such as mass, charge, pressure, etc.). Without a satisfactory theory of
                        quantum gravity, one cannot perform such a computation for black holes. Some progress has been
                        made in various approaches to quantum gravity. In 1995, <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Strominger">Andrew Strominger</a> and <a

                        that counting the microstates of a specific <a

                        reproduced the Bekenstein–Hawking entropy. Since then, similar results have been reported
                        for different black holes both in string theory and in other approaches to quantum gravity like

                    <h4 class="post-h4">Information loss paradox</h4>
                    <p>
                        Because a black hole has only a few internal parameters, most of the information about the
                        matter that went into forming the black hole is lost. Regardless of the type of matter which
                        goes into a black hole, it appears that only information concerning the total mass, charge, and
                        angular momentum are conserved. As long as black holes were thought to persist forever this
                        information loss is not that problematic, as the information can be thought of as existing
                        inside the black hole, inaccessible from the outside, but represented on the event horizon in
                        accordance with the holographic principle. However, black holes slowly evaporate by emitting
                        Hawking radiation. This radiation does not appear to carry any additional information about the
                        matter that formed the black hole, meaning that this information appears to be gone
                        forever.

                        The question whether information is truly lost in black holes (the <a

                            bet</a>). In
                        quantum mechanics, loss of information corresponds to the violation of a property called <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitarity_(physics)">unitarity</a>, and it has been
                        argued that loss of unitarity would also imply violation of
                        conservation of energy, though this has also been disputed. Over recent years evidence
                        has been building that indeed information and unitarity are preserved in a full quantum
                        gravitational treatment of the problem.

                        that black hole complementarity fails to solve the information paradox. According to quantum
                        field theory in curved spacetime, a single emission of Hawking radiation involves two mutually
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement">entangled</a> particles. The
                        outgoing particle escapes and is emitted as a quantum of Hawking
                        radiation; the infalling particle is swallowed by the black hole. Assume a black hole formed a
                        finite time in the past and will fully evaporate away in some finite time in the future. Then,
                        it will emit only a finite amount of information encoded within its Hawking radiation. According
                        to research by physicists like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Page_(physicist)">Don
                            Page</a> and Leonard Susskind, there will eventually be
                        a time by which an outgoing particle must be entangled with all the Hawking radiation the black
                        hole has previously emitted. This seemingly creates a paradox: a principle called "monogamy of
                        entanglement" requires that, like any quantum system, the outgoing particle cannot be fully
                        entangled with two other systems at the same time; yet here the outgoing particle appears to be
                        entangled both with the infalling particle and, independently, with past Hawking radiation.
                        In order to resolve this contradiction, physicists may eventually be forced to give up one of
                        three time-tested principles: Einstein's <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_principle">equivalence principle</a>,
                        unitarity, or local quantum
                        field theory. One possible solution, which violates the equivalence principle, is that a
                        "firewall" destroys incoming particles at the event horizon. In general, which if any of
                        these assumptions should be abandoned remains a topic of debate.
