                    <p>A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing—no particles or
                        even electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from it. The theory of general
                        relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole.

                        The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon.
                        Although the event horizon has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object
                        crossing it, according to general relativity it has no locally detectable features. In many
                        ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light. Moreover, quantum
                        field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the
                        same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This
                        temperature is on the order of billionths of a kelvin for black holes of stellar mass, making it
                        essentially impossible to observe.

                        Objects whose gravitational fields are too strong for light to escape were first considered in
                        the 18th century by John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace.[7] The first modern solution of
                        general relativity that would characterize a black hole was found by Karl Schwarzschild in 1916,
                        although its interpretation as a region of space from which nothing can escape was first
                        published by David Finkelstein in 1958. Black holes were long considered a mathematical
                        curiosity; it was not until the 1960s that theoretical work showed they were a generic
                        prediction of general relativity. The discovery of neutron stars by Jocelyn Bell Burnell in 1967
                        sparked interest in gravitationally collapsed compact objects as a possible astrophysical
                        reality.

                        Black holes of stellar mass are expected to form when very massive stars collapse at the end of
                        their life cycle. After a black hole has formed, it can continue to grow by absorbing mass from
                        its surroundings. By absorbing other stars and merging with other black holes, supermassive
                        black holes of millions of solar masses (M☉) may form. There is consensus that supermassive
                        black holes exist in the centers of most galaxies.

                        The presence of a black hole can be inferred through its interaction with other matter and with
                        electromagnetic radiation such as visible light. Matter that falls onto a black hole can form an
                        external accretion disk heated by friction, forming quasars, some of the brightest objects in
                        the universe. Stars passing too close to a supermassive black hole can be shred into streamers
                        that shine very brightly before being "swallowed." If there are other stars orbiting a black
                        hole, their orbits can be used to determine the black hole's mass and location. Such
                        observations can be used to exclude possible alternatives such as neutron stars. In this way,
                        astronomers have identified numerous stellar black hole candidates in binary systems, and
                        established that the radio source known as Sagittarius A*, at the core of the Milky Way galaxy,
                        contains a supermassive black hole of about 4.3 million solar masses.

                        On 11 February 2016, the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the Virgo collaboration announced the
                        first direct detection of gravitational waves, which also represented the first observation of a
                        black hole merger. As of December 2018, eleven gravitational wave events have been observed that
                        originated from ten merging black holes (along with one binary neutron star merger). On 10 April
                        2019, the first direct image of a black hole and its vicinity was published, following
                        observations made by the Event Horizon Telescope in 2017 of the supermassive black hole in
                        Messier 87's galactic centre.

                        The idea of a body so massive that even light could not escape was briefly proposed by
                        astronomical pioneer and English clergyman John Michell in a letter published in November 1784.
                        Michell's simplistic calculations assumed such a body might have the same density as the Sun,
                        and concluded that such a body would form when a star's diameter exceeds the Sun's by a factor
                        of 500, and the surface escape velocity exceeds the usual speed of light. Michell correctly
                        noted that such supermassive but non-radiating bodies might be detectable through their
                        gravitational effects on nearby visible bodies. Scholars of the time were initially
                        excited by the proposal that giant but invisible stars might be hiding in plain view, but
                        enthusiasm dampened when the wavelike nature of light became apparent in the early nineteenth
                        century.

                        If light were a wave rather than a "corpuscle", it is unclear what, if any, influence gravity
                        would have on escaping light waves. Modern physics discredits Michell's notion of a light
                        ray shooting directly from the surface of a supermassive star, being slowed down by the star's
                        gravity, stopping, and then free-falling back to the star's surface.

                    <p>
                        In 1915, Albert Einstein developed his theory of general relativity, having earlier shown that
                        gravity does influence light's motion. Only a few months later, Karl Schwarzschild found a
                        solution to the Einstein field equations, which describes the gravitational field of a point
                        mass and a spherical mass. A few months after Schwarzschild, Johannes Droste, a student of
                        Hendrik Lorentz, independently gave the same solution for the point mass and wrote more
                        extensively about its properties. This solution had a peculiar behaviour at what is now
                        called the Schwarzschild radius, where it became singular, meaning that some of the terms in the
                        Einstein equations became infinite. The nature of this surface was not quite understood at the
                        time. In 1924, Arthur Eddington showed that the singularity disappeared after a change of
                        coordinates (see Eddington–Finkelstein coordinates), although it took until 1933 for Georges
                        Lemaître to realize that this meant the singularity at the Schwarzschild radius was a
                        non-physical coordinate singularity. Arthur Eddington did however comment on the possibility
                        of a star with mass compressed to the Schwarzschild radius in a 1926 book, noting that
                        Einstein's theory allows us to rule out overly large densities for visible stars like Betelgeuse
                        because "a star of 250 million km radius could not possibly have so high a density as the sun.
                        Firstly, the force of gravitation would be so great that light would be unable to escape from
                        it, the rays falling back to the star like a stone to the earth. Secondly, the red shift of the
                        spectral lines would be so great that the spectrum would be shifted out of existence. Thirdly,
                        the mass would produce so much curvature of the space-time metric that space would close up
                        around the star, leaving us outside (i.e., nowhere)."

                        In 1931, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar calculated, using special relativity, that a non-rotating
                        body of electron-degenerate matter above a certain limiting mass (now called the Chandrasekhar
                        limit at 1.4 M☉) has no stable solutions. His arguments were opposed by many of his
                        contemporaries like Eddington and Lev Landau, who argued that some yet unknown mechanism would
                        stop the collapse. They were partly correct: a white dwarf slightly more massive than the
                        Chandrasekhar limit will collapse into a neutron star, which is itself stable. But in 1939,
                        Robert Oppenheimer and others predicted that neutron stars above another limit (the
                        Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit) would collapse further for the reasons presented by
                        Chandrasekhar, and concluded that no law of physics was likely to intervene and stop at least
                        some stars from collapsing to black holes. Their original calculations, based on the Pauli
                        exclusion principle, gave it as 0.7 M☉; subsequent consideration of strong force-mediated
                        neutron-neutron repulsion raised the estimate to approximately 1.5 M☉ to 3.0 M☉.
                        Observations of the neutron star merger GW170817, which is thought to have generated a black
                        hole shortly afterward, have refined the TOV limit estimate to ~2.17 M☉.

                        Oppenheimer and his co-authors interpreted the singularity at the boundary of the Schwarzschild
                        radius as indicating that this was the boundary of a bubble in which time stopped. This is a
                        valid point of view for external observers, but not for infalling observers. Because of this
                        property, the collapsed stars were called "frozen stars", because an outside observer would see
                        the surface of the star frozen in time at the instant where its collapse takes it to the
                        Schwarzschild radius.

                    <h4>Golden age</h4> <br>
                    <div class="post-image">

                    </div>
                    <p>In 1958, David Finkelstein identified the Schwarzschild surface as an event horizon, "a perfect
                        unidirectional membrane: causal influences can cross it in only one direction".This did not
                        strictly contradict Oppenheimer's results, but extended them to include the point of view of
                        infalling observers. Finkelstein's solution extended the Schwarzschild solution for the future
                        of observers falling into a black hole. A complete extension had already been found by Martin
                        Kruskal, who was urged to publish it.

                        These results came at the beginning of the golden age of general relativity, which was marked by
                        general relativity and black holes becoming mainstream subjects of research. This process was
                        helped by the discovery of pulsars by Jocelyn Bell Burnell in 1967, which, by 1969, were
                        shown to be rapidly rotating neutron stars. Until that time, neutron stars, like black
                        holes, were regarded as just theoretical curiosities; but the discovery of pulsars showed their
                        physical relevance and spurred a further interest in all types of compact objects that might be
                        formed by gravitational collapse.

                        In this period more general black hole solutions were found. In 1963, Roy Kerr found the exact
                        solution for a rotating black hole. Two years later, Ezra Newman found the axisymmetric solution
                        for a black hole that is both rotating and electrically charged. Through the work of Werner
                        Israel, Brandon Carter, and David Robinson the no-hair theorem emerged, stating
                        that a stationary black hole solution is completely described by the three parameters of the
                        Kerr–Newman metric: mass, angular momentum, and electric charge.

                        At first, it was suspected that the strange features of the black hole solutions were
                        pathological artifacts from the symmetry conditions imposed, and that the singularities would
                        not appear in generic situations. This view was held in particular by Vladimir Belinsky, Isaak
                        Khalatnikov, and Evgeny Lifshitz, who tried to prove that no singularities appear in generic
                        solutions. However, in the late 1960s Roger Penrose and Stephen Hawking used global
                        techniques to prove that singularities appear generically. For this work, Penrose received
                        half of the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics, Hawking having died in 2018.

                        Work by James Bardeen, Jacob Bekenstein, Carter, and Hawking in the early 1970s led to the
                        formulation of black hole thermodynamics. These laws describe the behaviour of a black hole
                        in close analogy to the laws of thermodynamics by relating mass to energy, area to entropy, and
                        surface gravity to temperature. The analogy was completed when Hawking, in 1974, showed that
                        quantum field theory implies that black holes should radiate like a black body with a
                        temperature proportional to the surface gravity of the black hole, predicting the effect now
                        known as Hawking radiation.</p>

                    <h4>Etymology</h4> <br>
                    
                    <p>John Michell used the term "dark star", and in the early 20th century, physicists used the
                        term "gravitationally collapsed object". Science writer Marcia Bartusiak traces the term "black
                        hole" to physicist Robert H. Dicke, who in the early 1960s reportedly compared the phenomenon to
                        the Black Hole of Calcutta, notorious as a prison where people entered but never left alive.

                        The term "black hole" was used in print by Life and Science News magazines in 1963, and by
                        science journalist Ann Ewing in her article "'Black Holes' in Space", dated 18 January 1964,
                        which was a report on a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science held
                        in Cleveland, Ohio.

                        In December 1967, a student reportedly suggested the phrase "black hole" at a lecture by John
                        Wheeler; Wheeler adopted the term for its brevity and "advertising value", and it quickly
                        caught on, leading some to credit Wheeler with coining the phrase.</p>
